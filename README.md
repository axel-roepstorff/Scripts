# Scripts
This will be a collection of assorted scripts to share and learn from.

## SimulationThesis
The only current project in the repository is a simulation constructed for an agent-based model of three regions with quasi-idiosyncratic preference shocks for regional sorting.
The script is very crude and probably badly optimised but it serves as a practical illustration of the thoughts behind the theoretical model outlined in my Bachelor's Thesis.
